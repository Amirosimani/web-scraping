All the demands are for is equal rights (which should be a given in any democracy), ending military occupation, and allowing the displaced Palestinian diaspora to return to their homeland (a policy which, if anybody's about to attack its feasibility, is literally what Israel has had in place for the global Jewish diaspora since its inception). \nThe companies that they're asking for divestment from are literally defense companies, the people who manufacture the weapons, bulldozers, and defense systems that allow the Israeli occupation to continue  and who actually directly profit from the occupation because of it (meaning that they stand as a barrier to peace and decolonization even if the political tide among Israelis changes)-- and honestly is it controversial to say that nobody should be making a profit from war and child imprisonment?\nIsrael/Palestine is a socially and historically complicated issue-- the fact that Israel is a country of holocaust survivors and refugees of global antisemitism doesn't change the fact that the state of Israel and its military (and military-industrial complex) have brought incredible suffering to the Palestinian people. And a continuation of the status quo of militarism, occupation, and institutionalized discrimination since 1948 has led to persistent violence that harms Israeli and Palestinian civilians alike (though, if you look at the numbers, Palestinians have suffered far more). \nThis outlines a non-violent way of challenging the status quo and moving towards peace and equality in a way that could actually work, based on the history of divestment movements-- rather than platitudes about how everybody is affected by violence and how we're all human or something, this campaign attacks the material roots of this violence by attacking 1. the economic structure that stands to profit from this violence and 2. the political structures and policies that perpetuate it. \nand there's a lot of reasons to be in favor of that that are not hating Jews or Holocaust denial.", "author": "anonymous", "up": 23, "datetime": "February 1, 2016 @ 11:26 am"},

Most Palestinian refugees would not be considered refugees by the UN if it wasn't for Arab lobbying to create a new category for them, so the Arab countries wouldn't have to take responsibility for them. Palestinians have a right to return to a state of their own, which their leadership has refused (and today their leadership incites and promotes anti-Semitism).

Some groups call for new member hazing, ostracize members if/when they quit, and create their own social barriers that prohibit and inhibit some people from joining to begin with. My first year I was deliberately excluded from one of the political groups on campus. I tried joining their social group, and they made it abundantly clear that they didn't want me there. Yet, you don't see me writing an article complaining about them. Additionally, hundreds of people go through A Capella auditions, and only a small fraction are given a spot in a group. More than just singing ability goes into that membership process as well.\nTargeting sororities is simply convenient because there are existing assumptions and pre-formulated scripts that says sorority women are nothing but snobby party girls who buy their friends. Articles like this are simply a ill-intended sustaining of those scripts. Regardless of how many sorority women are leaders on this campus, work jobs to pay for college and dues, and come from all walks of life, we are constantly reduced to a set of stereotypes and misrepresentations. To degrade a massive group of women (Panhellenic is ~600 people) is nothing short of impulsive stereotyping and deliberate devaluing of women (even if the author of this article is a woman). \nHow about we challenge those prescriptive assumptions and take a moment to validate the positive that come from sorority communities, namely the forging of community support groups, creating social sites that remedy the BC/CC/SEAS/JTS divide, and the hundreds of hours spent volunteering and thousands raised for cancer research (Relay for Life) and directed towards other philanthropic causes.

Earlier tonight in Butler 209, a member of the old Bwog board and I were waiting for Orgo Night to begin, when another friend pointed out the two members of CUSS next to us vocally ridiculing Bwog. Ankeet Ball and Lara Karaaslan, despite full knowledge of a former Bwog editor standing immediately next to them, made it a point to disparage our website to our faces, in detail. The former Bwog editor asked for Ankeet and Lara\u2019s respect on behalf of CUSS towards their partner organization, at which point Ankeet continued to devalue our site\u2019s content and design. Once Ankeet began to condemn the editorial board, I stepped in and introduced myself as current Editor in Chief of Bwog. Despite my thanking Ankeet and Lara for their constructive criticisms, they continued to disparage our organization as a whole. I ended the conversation by asking Lara and Ankeet whether or not they wanted Bwog to continue to host CUSS videos on our site.\nHowever, as Editor in Chief of Bwog, I am in a position that entitles me full right to make that decision myself. As your partner organization, Bwog expected mutual respect from CUSS, though because this is clearly no longer the case, we have chosen to sever all ties from your group.\nEffective immediately, CUSS will no longer have access to Bwog Vimeo premium, which is owned, operated, and financed by Blue and White Publishing Inc. As the owner of the site, Bwog retains the full right to do with the videos as it may please, which will most likely result in their removal from internet. Every member of CUSS has been removed from the video@bwog.com listserv, and Anna has been removed from our masthead as Video Editor. Finally, we will also remove every post from our site and social media accounts that features CUSS-related content.\nMoving forward, Bwog as an entity will no longer be affiliated with the Columbia University (No Budget) Sketch Show. We ask that you please remove every affiliation with Bwog from your social media accounts, including but not limited to Facebook and Instagram. This also means that because Bwog has the rights to every video previously produced by CUSS, any alteration, reproduction, or republication of those videos, in any manner, would violate copyright law. In the event you choose not to comply with any of the aforementioned, we will be forced to take legal action against your organization.\nI am available to speak in person with anyone who would like to do so.\nMason", "author": "the email", "up": 21, "datetime": "December 28, 2015 @ 2:05 pm"},

He is merely an actor within an (allegedly) flawed electoral system that is closely overseen by the administration (specifically, the office of Fraternity and Sorority Life).  If there is a conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, the onus should fall on Yvonne Pitts to deal with it.  Don't chastise Teddy for merely doing his job.\nFurthermore, in terms of fact-checking: the applications were sent out before the election took place.  They were distributed via email/google drive at 8:30, a few minutes before the election process for the Judicial Board Chair was to take place.  Yes, this did not happen 24 hours before the election, but nowhere in the application was this promised.  Don't take my word for it; here is an excerpt from the J-board chair application:\n\"Elections for the position will be held on Monday, 12/7 at 8pm. Form submissions will function as a candidate's voting platform, and will be sent to all voting members in the IGC (voting members of the IGC are chapter presidents and/ or assigned chapter representatives). At elections, applicants will be asked to make a two minute speech.\"\nNowhere in that does it give any timeframe for the distribution.  They were distributed.  Point Teddy.\nFurthermore, the article alleges that \"(Panhellenic President) Barnett confirmed in a comment to Bwog that Finkelstein did not distribute candidate platforms prior to the election and that she had distributed Greenblatt\u2019s platform as a result.\"  Did she only distribute Greenblatt's platform and not Teddy's? If so, how is this not an even more egregious form of electioneering?\nLastly, as a voting member who attended that meeting, I can confirm that distributing the platforms earlier would have made no difference in the outcome.  The position is fairly narrow in scope, so the differences in their platforms would be negligible (and I can confirm this based on the contents of their speeches).  Furthermore, since IFC chapters are brought in front of the Judicial Board far more frequently than chapters of any other council, it is in the interest of all of the IFC chapters to vote for an IFC member to be the Judicial Board Chair.  IFC chapters get to cast two votes (for the same reason - they have the most at stake in this election), so this would give Teddy 22 votes right off the bat.  That's a majority of the 40 available votes.  At a certain point, you have to grow up and learn how to lose with dignity.  This article shows that Ms. Greenblatt has a long way to go in this department.\nOne last thing - this was NOT the only competitive election of the evening.  VP of PR and Marketing was contested between two candidates.

The amendment aims to give each Greek group on campus proportional power to the people they represent. Right now, out of the 28 possible votes, Panhellenic sororities are given 6 of them, even though 55% of Greek life is from Panhellenic membership. Votes should be proportionate to the amount of people they represent, it's as simple as that. Furthermore, the amendment was never given a chance to begin with because it was conducted under the preexisting voting system.

Indeed, I would much rather have a professor who is well qualified than one with whom I can identify.  What also needs to be discussed are the benefits for the instructors. One professor I had in American History was brilliant and his class was perhaps one of my favorite during my four years at Columbia. Though I learned a lot, I can safely say my professor also learned much about Native American history because of the perspective I brought to the class. Columbia classes are meant to be welcoming but not supposed to make you feel easy or comfortable; they're goal is to push your's, and everyone's, intellectual limits by challenging what you already believe.
