All the demands are for is equal rights (which should be a given in any democracy), ending military occupation, and allowing the displaced Palestinian diaspora to return to their homeland (a policy which, if anybody's about to attack its feasibility, is literally what Israel has had in place for the global Jewish diaspora since its inception). \nThe companies that they're asking for divestment from are literally defense companies, the people who manufacture the weapons, bulldozers, and defense systems that allow the Israeli occupation to continue  and who actually directly profit from the occupation because of it (meaning that they stand as a barrier to peace and decolonization even if the political tide among Israelis changes)-- and honestly is it controversial to say that nobody should be making a profit from war and child imprisonment?\nIsrael/Palestine is a socially and historically complicated issue-- the fact that Israel is a country of holocaust survivors and refugees of global antisemitism doesn't change the fact that the state of Israel and its military (and military-industrial complex) have brought incredible suffering to the Palestinian people. And a continuation of the status quo of militarism, occupation, and institutionalized discrimination since 1948 has led to persistent violence that harms Israeli and Palestinian civilians alike (though, if you look at the numbers, Palestinians have suffered far more). \nThis outlines a non-violent way of challenging the status quo and moving towards peace and equality in a way that could actually work, based on the history of divestment movements-- rather than platitudes about how everybody is affected by violence and how we're all human or something, this campaign attacks the material roots of this violence by attacking 1. the economic structure that stands to profit from this violence and 2. the political structures and policies that perpetuate it. \nand there's a lot of reasons to be in favor of that that are not hating Jews or Holocaust denial.", "author": "anonymous", "up": 23, "datetime": "February 1, 2016 @ 11:26 am"},

They obviously don't have the ability to help their own interests, so maybe pressure should be placed on the Palestinian Authority to negotiate seriously? Also, claiming that the land won in 67 is Arab land is not true considering it was won in a defensive war. Most Palestinian refugees would not be considered refugees by the UN if it wasn't for Arab lobbying to create a new category for them, so the Arab countries wouldn't have to take responsibility for them. Palestinians have a right to return to a state of their own, which their leadership has refused (and today their leadership incites and promotes anti-Semitism).

Some groups call for new member hazing, ostracize members if/when they quit, and create their own social barriers that prohibit and inhibit some people from joining to begin with. My first year I was deliberately excluded from one of the political groups on campus. I tried joining their social group, and they made it abundantly clear that they didn't want me there. Yet, you don't see me writing an article complaining about them. Additionally, hundreds of people go through A Capella auditions, and only a small fraction are given a spot in a group. More than just singing ability goes into that membership process as well.\nTargeting sororities is simply convenient because there are existing assumptions and pre-formulated scripts that says sorority women are nothing but snobby party girls who buy their friends. Articles like this are simply a ill-intended sustaining of those scripts. Regardless of how many sorority women are leaders on this campus, work jobs to pay for college and dues, and come from all walks of life, we are constantly reduced to a set of stereotypes and misrepresentations. To degrade a massive group of women (Panhellenic is ~600 people) is nothing short of impulsive stereotyping and deliberate devaluing of women (even if the author of this article is a woman). \nHow about we challenge those prescriptive assumptions and take a moment to validate the positive that come from sorority communities, namely the forging of community support groups, creating social sites that remedy the BC/CC/SEAS/JTS divide, and the hundreds of hours spent volunteering and thousands raised for cancer research (Relay for Life) and directed towards other philanthropic causes. As a Columbia community, we can do better than to minimize a massive group of women into a degrading set of assumptions and actively ignore the benefits they offer.", "author": "We can do better than this...", "up": 70, "datetime": "January 27, 2016 @ 2:42 pm"},

I'm not going to lie to you, the recruitment process itself is definitely outdated and a little superficial, but the conversations that you have with the girls are real - we want to get to know you, honestly. Of course, we can't talk about boys or alcohol but that is not our decision, it's national. That means that no sorority in the entire country can discuss these things, not just Columbia. I feel that we're really being attacked for a system that goes completely over our head, and is mandated by the national Panhellenic committee. That being said, we don't NEED to talk about boys or alcohol or brownstones in recruitment because that's not what the sorority is about. I can't tell you how many times I've chosen not to go out and had at least 10 sorority sisters ask me if I wanted to watch a movie or eat take out or do homework or just talk. Of course going to parties is a fun thing I do with my sisters, but I also do that with my friends who aren't in sororities because that's what I like to do - but nobody is ever forced to attend events like this, and most of what I do in my sorority has nothing to do with booze or boys. \nI'm not going to lie to you, my first semester in my sorority wasn't amazing because I didn't know everyone yet and I felt a bit lost - it's completely unreasonable to think that I would have an instant connection with everyone. But PLEASE, don't listen to the girl who says that if you doubt your decision \"that's not going to change,\" because it definitely did for me. I was considering dissafiliating my first semester, but then I met new girls in my sorority who I didn't know before, I became an active part of the community and took up a leadership role, and now it's honestly the best part of my life here at Columbia.\nDon't believe everything you read, being in a sorority is an amazing and rewarding experience.", "author": "pnms please read", "up": 21, "datetime": "January 27, 2016 @ 4:58 pm"},

Earlier tonight in Butler 209, a member of the old Bwog board and I were waiting for Orgo Night to begin, when another friend pointed out the two members of CUSS next to us vocally ridiculing Bwog. Ankeet Ball and Lara Karaaslan, despite full knowledge of a former Bwog editor standing immediately next to them, made it a point to disparage our website to our faces, in detail. The former Bwog editor asked for Ankeet and Lara\u2019s respect on behalf of CUSS towards their partner organization, at which point Ankeet continued to devalue our site\u2019s content and design. Once Ankeet began to condemn the editorial board, I stepped in and introduced myself as current Editor in Chief of Bwog. Despite my thanking Ankeet and Lara for their constructive criticisms, they continued to disparage our organization as a whole. I ended the conversation by asking Lara and Ankeet whether or not they wanted Bwog to continue to host CUSS videos on our site.\nHowever, as Editor in Chief of Bwog, I am in a position that entitles me full right to make that decision myself. As your partner organization, Bwog expected mutual respect from CUSS, though because this is clearly no longer the case, we have chosen to sever all ties from your group.\nEffective immediately, CUSS will no longer have access to Bwog Vimeo premium, which is owned, operated, and financed by Blue and White Publishing Inc. As the owner of the site, Bwog retains the full right to do with the videos as it may please, which will most likely result in their removal from internet. Every member of CUSS has been removed from the video@bwog.com listserv, and Anna has been removed from our masthead as Video Editor. Finally, we will also remove every post from our site and social media accounts that features CUSS-related content.\nMoving forward, Bwog as an entity will no longer be affiliated with the Columbia University (No Budget) Sketch Show. We ask that you please remove every affiliation with Bwog from your social media accounts, including but not limited to Facebook and Instagram. This also means that because Bwog has the rights to every video previously produced by CUSS, any alteration, reproduction, or republication of those videos, in any manner, would violate copyright law. In the event you choose not to comply with any of the aforementioned, we will be forced to take legal action against your organization.\nI am available to speak in person with anyone who would like to do so.\nMason", "author": "the email", "up": 21, "datetime": "December 28, 2015 @ 2:05 pm"},

He is merely an actor within an (allegedly) flawed electoral system that is closely overseen by the administration (specifically, the office of Fraternity and Sorority Life).  If there is a conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, the onus should fall on Yvonne Pitts to deal with it.  Don't chastise Teddy for merely doing his job.\nFurthermore, in terms of fact-checking: the applications were sent out before the election took place.  They were distributed via email/google drive at 8:30, a few minutes before the election process for the Judicial Board Chair was to take place.  Yes, this did not happen 24 hours before the election, but nowhere in the application was this promised.  Don't take my word for it; here is an excerpt from the J-board chair application:\n\"Elections for the position will be held on Monday, 12/7 at 8pm. Form submissions will function as a candidate's voting platform, and will be sent to all voting members in the IGC (voting members of the IGC are chapter presidents and/ or assigned chapter representatives). At elections, applicants will be asked to make a two minute speech.\"\nNowhere in that does it give any timeframe for the distribution.  They were distributed.  Point Teddy.\nFurthermore, the article alleges that \"(Panhellenic President) Barnett confirmed in a comment to Bwog that Finkelstein did not distribute candidate platforms prior to the election and that she had distributed Greenblatt\u2019s platform as a result.\"  Did she only distribute Greenblatt's platform and not Teddy's? If so, how is this not an even more egregious form of electioneering?\nLastly, as a voting member who attended that meeting, I can confirm that distributing the platforms earlier would have made no difference in the outcome.  The position is fairly narrow in scope, so the differences in their platforms would be negligible (and I can confirm this based on the contents of their speeches).  Furthermore, since IFC chapters are brought in front of the Judicial Board far more frequently than chapters of any other council, it is in the interest of all of the IFC chapters to vote for an IFC member to be the Judicial Board Chair.  IFC chapters get to cast two votes (for the same reason - they have the most at stake in this election), so this would give Teddy 22 votes right off the bat.  That's a majority of the 40 available votes.  At a certain point, you have to grow up and learn how to lose with dignity.  This article shows that Ms. Greenblatt has a long way to go in this department.\nOne last thing - this was NOT the only competitive election of the evening.

The amendment aims to give each Greek group on campus proportional power to the people they represent. Right now, out of the 28 possible votes, Panhellenic sororities are given 6 of them, even though 55% of Greek life is from Panhellenic membership. Votes should be proportionate to the amount of people they represent, it's as simple as that. Furthermore, the amendment was never given a chance to begin with because it was conducted under the preexisting voting system. Of course those with more power, the IFC fraternities, are not going to give it up, so rather than the amendment being voted on in accordance with the opinions of the people, it was voted on in accordance with those already in power.", "author": "really", "up": 23, "datetime": "December 8, 2015 @ 11:13 pm"},

The opposition wasn't just coming from a white-privileged viewpoint,  and mentioning that DOES change the way we interpret the above exchange, and additionally, the way we understand current conflicts on campus.  Not all PoC have the same viewpoint about the current campus conflict, but that doesn't invalidate the concerns of those who do (whose comments are depicted above).

The core professors are supposedly all reading off the same playbook, so how is it that so many other students professors are apparently providing such a totally different experience?\n2) Ultimately, what CC is supposed to be teaching is the content of the books and what they meant to the people who wrote them. Their racist legacy is a totally different topic. There are other courses where you can learn all about that, if you so desire. It's like going into an economics class and complaining that the economics professor isn't focusing on how economics impacted colonialism and the slave trade.

Indeed, I would much rather have a professor who is well qualified than one with whom I can identify.  What also needs to be discussed are the benefits for the instructors. One professor I had in American History was brilliant and his class was perhaps one of my favorite during my four years at Columbia. Though I learned a lot, I can safely say my professor also learned much about Native American history because of the perspective I brought to the class. Columbia classes are meant to be welcoming but not supposed to make you feel easy or comfortable; they're goal is to push your's, and everyone's, intellectual limits by challenging what you already believe.

It's called a difference of opinion. Don't say mean things to me for mine, and I won't back. That goes for most things, again, provided you keep it without threats of violence. Challenge ideas, not people. Safety and comfort are two VERY different things.

{"down": 1, "content": "Hey! Stand Up for Science is a proposal the ACSRI has been working on \u2013 to divest from fossil fuel companies for the reason that they fund climate change denial, to put it in brief. This is the wrong message to send - it says that fossil fuel companies must simply accept climate change. Really, most publicly state that climate change is an issue, but continue to explore for new reserves with billions of dollars each year. Burning those reserves (and the ones already accounted for) will skyrocket us past 2\u00b0C of global warming. 80% of fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground. We must divest from fossil fuel companies, on the basis that they plan to burn fossil fuels. That sends the right message. Columbia is one of the best producers of climate change research. One of our scientists, Wally Broecker, coined the term \"global warming.\" We are past the point of standing up for science. We need to stand for action.", "author": null, "up": 8, "datetime": "September 16, 2015 @ 8:44 pm"},
{"down": 5, "content": "Fossil fuels are really important to the global economy and modern society.  We all know the obvious uses for fossil fuels: gasoline and the like. But through the petrochemicals industry fossils fuels touch our daily life in more ways than you may realize. For example, any plastic is made from a fossil fuel. In modern society, it is nearly impossible to live without using fossil fuels. Perhaps we could power our cars and heat our homes with alternative energy resources, but we could not make plastics and all of the other chemical products we made from oil and gas. When calling for fossil fuel divestment, it is important to see the products that oil and gas companies give to our society and the fact that their use is unavoidable. Many people simply don't understand all of the products that are made from oil gas and therefore don't understand how important the industry is.", "author": "Anonymous", "up": 1, "datetime": "September 17, 2015 @ 12:13 am"},
{"down": 0, "content": "Any analysis of the benefits of fossil fuels cannot be taken seriously without discussing the costs. No one is making the case that fossil fuels are not in the products we use on a daily basis, nor that fossil fuels are not one of the main reasons humanity has collectively achieved huge gains in living standards. However, you completely omit climate change in your analysis.\nUnmitigated climate change threatens to roll back two decades of development, according to the World Bank; and decades of global public health gains, according to leading public health experts. This week, a study came out in the journal Nature finding that global air pollution is responsible for 3.3 million deaths every year \u2013 this is more than the deaths from HIV and malaria combined \u2013 and much of it from fossil fuel use in our transportation, agricultural, and power sectors.\nThe international community has agreed that we must limit global warming to 2\u00b0C beyond pre-industrial levels, and that deep cuts in emissions are necessary to achieve that. Given these facts, and your legitimate point about the issue of alternatives, would you not agree that we should be using our minuscule Carbon Budget in areas where substitutes are not readily available, such as petrochemicals, but not in areas where alternatives do exist, such as the power sector? The costs of renewable energy are plummeting every year, and it makes no environmental, or even financial, sense to continue investing in fossil fuel power infrastructure.\nAnd yet, fossil fuel companies continue lobbying against meaningful public policies that would lower our reliance on them and, potentially, increase funding into the very research that could lead to the alternatives you seek. So you see, this is not an economics issue\u2014it is very much a political one, and that is why fossil fuel divestment is one crucial part of the equation.", "author": "CDCJ Member", "up": 2, "datetime": "September 18, 2015 @ 3:18 am"},

{"down": 0, "content": "The idea that 80% of proven fossil fuel reserves need to stay underground is based on data from an IPCC report that stipulated a \"Carbon Budget\" i.e. the amount of CO2 emissions the world (so not just the U.S.) can collectively emit while still having a likely chance (50%) of remaining below 2\u00b0C of global warming beyond preindustrial levels, after which positive feedback loops will make climate change catastrophic and irreversible. \nFinancial experts, scientists, and economists quantified the carbon content of the proven reserves that are on the balance sheets of fossil fuel companies and, using the IPCC Carbon Budget as a baseline, determined that fossil fuel companies have 5x the amount that can be safely burned to stay below 2\u00b0C. To have a 50-50 chance of staying below 2\u00b0C, 66% of fossil fuel reserves must be kept underground (this figure is conservative and is used by the International Energy Agency). For a 66% chance of remaining below 2\u00b0C, 80% must be kept underground. Policymakers, civil society, and grassroots activists have rallied behind the 80% figure since they argue (logically) that humanity deserves more than a 50-50 chance.\nThis figure does not include probable reserves, and if it did, the amount of fossil fuel that would have to stay underground would be even larger (and exponentially so if you want to account for Resource Base as well).\nFinally, the Carbon Budget is global and does not apply to the U.S. However, scientists and economists have taken this further and have explored the idea of adding geographical and political layers to these figures. A study recently published in the journal Nature found that 80% of coal reserves, 50% of natural gas reserves, and 30% of oil reserves must be kept underground, and they also outlined which nations' reserves are most at risk (e.g. 90% of U.S. coal reserves must be kept underground).\nPlease contact CDCJ for these studies and materials and we will happily provide them for you.", "author": "CDCJ Member", "up": 4, "datetime": "September 18, 2015 @ 2:49 am"},

Columbia thus spent over $1,000 (one thousand dollars) effectively sponsoring a defamation and harassment movement against Paul.\"\n\"In a comparison of the 2013 and 2014 versions of Columbia\u2019s Gender Based\nMisconduct Policies, it is evident that Columbia deleted any references with regard to the privacy of the respondent. This deletion occurred after Emma had begun a campaign against Paul.\"\nFrom Columbia\u2019s Student Policies and Procedures on Discrimination and Harassment -- \"All students are protected from retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation... Retaliation occurs when an alleged perpetrator or respondent, her or his friends or associates, or other member of the University community intimidates, threatens, coerces, harasses, or discriminates against an individual who has made a complaint, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under these policies and procedures\"\nAnd there's more.

Even if you think Nungesser is a violent serial rapist, think about the next guy who isn't. We can't set a precedent of letting mass opinion override the university's duty to protect ALL of its students. \nThe part I don't understand -- and I hope someone can clear this up -- is how Nungesser is arguing that this harassment constitutions GENDER-BASED harassment. He's suing under Title IX and repeatedly says throughout the document that he has suffered gender-based harassment. I'm sort of rooting for him at this point, but unless he demonstrates that there is a gendered dimension to the movement against him, I worry that this will fail. \nThat said, I'm no lawyer, so could someone help me out in evaluating this?\nP.S.

It's beyond silly how quickly people will voice their dismissive opinions in conversation or online about a so-called \"truth\" they concluded from sources two or three degrees removed from themselves. \nAt the end of the day, the only people who actually know what happened are Emma and Paul, and even they probably have a skewed or fucked up perspective on something that happened that long ago. \nWhat it symbolizes, that sexual assault is bad, is the important matter at hand. I surmise that people are so distraught by the case because of the implication that a sexual partner (even a sexual partner you've slept with in the past) can say no at any time before or during sex, and continuing to have sex beyond that no is rape. I imagine men (disclosure: I'm a guy) are  most disturbed by this implication.\nThe one group that I know is fucked in the head is the fickle mob audience surrounding this whole thing because I can't rationally conclude whether Emma or Paul is right as a third party observer.

Having a conversation is important. having a conversation online like this is important, too. Why? Because, from what I have heard, if someone tries to organize a meeting that discusses this topic, the loudest and the most obnoxious win. In CC case, the NRT and activists. They are into-your-face-obnoxious bullies, who will not discuss the topic from any other angle but theirs. \nYou may say that we don't know what happened exactly between the two of them. But for Emma to so openly, and so fiercely, unapologetically harass a young man, she should have some proof rape happened. Don't you think? To get awards for your \"bravery\", to visit the White House, to play \"an expert\" on sexual assault, you'd better have something to show for your claims.\nHow do you think this would play out in the court of law? That's what we need to ask ourselves? Not what we FEEL happened. Would you like to be accused and punished in the court of public opinion, based on one person's word alone, and how people FEEL about your alleged crime?

Certainly we know that he was trying to describe the struggle between good and evil, right? \n(picks up an apple from his desk) Okay. The most intriguing character, as we all know from our reading, was (writing \"SATAN\" on the blackboard) Satan. Now, was Milton trying to tell us that being bad was more fun than being good?\n(He takes a bite out of the apple; a long pause as he chews and realizes that the class remains unmoved)\nOkay...don't write this down, but I find Milton probably as boring as you find Milton. Mrs. Milton found him boring, too. He, uh, he's a little bit long-winded, he doesn't translate very well into our generation, and his jokes are terrible. \n(the bell rings, and the students begin to leave) But that does not relieve you from your responsibility for this material!

I, for one, think they've done plenty in the course of 1 year, and I truly believe they're actively working on improving the resources they are giving us.

Keep in mind that this is a process, and all you're doing at this point is being counterproductive to it. Do you really expect all the rapists on campus to disappear overnight because of your toxic publicity stunts? \nThis is a problem that the students and the school need to tackle together, and I'm ashamed to say you're not pulling your weight. In fact, you're actively drowning out the goals of what was initially an admirable movement. Instead of aimlessly yelling \"MAKE IT BETTER MAKE IT BETTER\", why don't you give us a list of exactly what you want to be better and how you're going to make it better. These things you want require manpower and money. Start a fundraiser to better support the resources you want. Volunteer in facilities and institutions you want to create.

Columbia is not unique. Columbia is an academic institution, not a judicial court designed to uphold the law. Of course the university cannot be impartial in these cases, but why is the expectation still that the university should be responsible for dealing with complex legal cases impartially? If a murder happened at Columbia the murderer wouldn't be tried by an administration that lacks legal training. Why is the same expectation placed on rape cases? \nColumbia isn't perfect, but it is not different from its peers. In fact, in the past year Columbia has done a lot more than many of its peers in terms of educating its students about sexual assault and providing them with forums and resources to have productive dialogues about the complexities of these issues. It's role is to educate, not to sentence. If you want to \"educate\" incoming students about rape culture on campus and the issues with the gender misconduct policy at Columbia there are plenty of other less sensationalist means of doing it that are more productive and reflect the nuance of the issue.
